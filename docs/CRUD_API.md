# Online Retail API Documentation

This API provides endpoints to manage products in the online retail application. The API is designed as a RESTful service that supports the standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

> **Note:** The API is assumed to be hosted on `http://localhost:8000`. Adjust the base URL as needed for your production environment.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Backend Setup:**
   - Ensure you have a backend server running on port `8000` (or update the API base URL in your frontend).
   - Implement a RESTful API that supports CRUD operations for products.
   - Use your preferred backend language or framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, etc.).

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The frontend application (React) will be accessible on the URL provided by your development server (commonly `http://localhost:3000`).

3. **Configuration:**
   - The frontend fetches products from `http://localhost:8000/products/`. Update this URL if your backend is hosted elsewhere.
   - Ensure that CORS is configured on your backend server to allow requests from your frontend's origin.

## CRUD Examples

Below are example commands using curl to perform CRUD operations against the API.

### Create a Product (POST)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/products/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "product_id": "prod_004",
    "name": "Bluetooth Speaker",
    "price": 59.99,
    "description": "Portable Bluetooth speaker with deep bass.",
    "seller_id": "user_002"
  }'
```

### Read All Products (GET)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/products/
```

### Update a Product (PUT)

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/products/prod_004 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Bluetooth Speaker - Updated",
    "price": 64.99,
    "description": "Updated description: Enhanced sound quality with longer battery life.",
    "seller_id": "user_002"
  }'
```

### Delete a Product (DELETE)

## Error Handling

All endpoints are expected to return proper HTTP status codes and JSON error messages. Common error status codes include:

- **400 Bad Request**: The request data is invalid or missing required fields.

- **404 Not Found**: The requested product does not exist.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

Example of an error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message"
}
```

## Future Work: Cart Endpoints

The CartPage currently displays a placeholder message ("Cart Management Coming Soon ðŸ›’"). In the future, similar CRUD endpoints can be developed for cart operations (e.g., adding items to a cart, removing items, and updating quantities).
